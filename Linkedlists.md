# Linked Lists

##Contiguous vs Linked Data Structures
Data Structures can be classified as either Contiguous or linked, depending on whether they use arrays or pointers.

### Contiguous Data Structures
Contiguous Data Structures are allocated using a single slice of memory. Contiguous data structures include arrays, heaps, and hash tables.

### Linked Data Structures
Linked data structures are constructed using distinct chunks of memory and are tied together using pointers. These include trees, graphs, and linked lists.

##Linked Lists
There are several different types of linked lists such as:

### Singly Linked List
