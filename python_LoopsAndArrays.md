# Loops

## For Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. If we want to print the numbers 1 through 10, we can do this:

```python
print 0
print 2
print 3
print 4
...
print 10
```
or this:

```python
for i in xrange(11):
  print i
```

they will both return:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

### Syntax

This is the syntax for a basic for loop:
```python

for i in xrange(x):
  # do something
```


The keyword 'for' lets python know that you want to use a for loop.
The variable 'i' represents your iteration
xrange(x) generates a list from 0 up to but not including x. xrange(10) will give you back numbers 0-9.
End your for loops statement with a colon, and write the code that you want repeated in the block immediatley below.

```python
for i in xrange(10):
  print i
```

The above statement uses the for statement to let python know that you want to use a for loop. 'i' holds your iteration, which are all the numbers generated by xrange(10). Every time the for loop executes the code within its block, i updates to the next number in xrange(10).

**Iterations starting from a number other than 0**

You can also start iterating from a number other than 0. 
Syntax:
```python
for i in xrange(x,y):
  # do something
```

Everything is the same except xrange takes an extra parameter. xrange(x,y) will generate all the numbers from x to y, not including y.
The following two code blocks are functionally the same:

```python
for i in xrange(3,10):
  print i
```

```python
for i in xrange(0,7):
  print i + 3
```

**Stepping**

xrange can take a third parameter that allows you to "step" or skip by a constant.
Syntax:
```python
for i in xrange(x,y,z):
  print i
```

Everything it the same except for the third parameter in xrange, 'z'. This parameter tells xrange to generate a list of numbers from x to y (not including y) for every z'th number.

For example:
```python
for i in xrange(0,10,2):
  print i
```
will print

```
0
2
4
6
8
```
and is equivalent to

```python
for i in xrange(0,5):
  print i*2
```

the regular for loop is technically
```python
for i in xrange(x,y,1):
  #pass
```
where 'i' iterates from x to y using the step of '1'.

**Backwards Iteration**
Using the above logic, you can iterate through a list backwards. That is, variable i will start at a large number and end at a smaller number.

```python
for i in xrange(10,0,-1):
  print i
```

Will produce
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```

**Backwards Iteration with Skipping**
We can iterate backwards with skips.

```python
for i in xrange(10,0,-2):
  print i
```
will produce

```
10
8
6
4
2
```

**Nested For loops**
You can nest for loops!

```python
for i in xrange(10):
  for j in xrange(10):
    print i+j
```

Nested for loops can be used to iterate over n-dimensional data structures. More next class!

## While loops
While loops are another kind of loop.
Syntax:
```python
while <expression>:
  # do something

```
The 'while' keyword lets Python know you want to use a while loop.
The <expression> returns a boolean value that will be iterated at every loop. Once the expression returns false, the while loop stops.

This is an example of printing all numbers from 0 to 10

```python
counter = 0
while counter < 11:
  print counter
  counter += 1
```
Note the use of a counter to trigger the break.



**While vs For loops**
When should you use a while loop over a for loop? A for loop is used when you know exactly the number of iterations you need. A while loop is used when you are unsure of the number of iterations in advance. Would you use a while loop or a for loop in the following scenarios?
  
1) Print numbers 0 to 10
2) Print characters of a string of length 10
3) Print characters of an arbitrary sized string
4) Print a stream of characters

# Arrays

Arrays hold collections of *things*.
In python, arrays are called "lists" and are not type-restricted. This means you can store objects of different types in the same list.

An aside - there are no primitive types in python.

## Static arrays vs Dynamic arrays

Local or "static" arrays are allocated on the stack and are alloted a fixed amount of space. This means that static arrays cannot "grow", and you are limited to the amount of space that you initially allocated to that array.

"Dynamic Arrays" are allocated on the heap, or the "free store". This means that dynamic arrays can "grow", and you can continue to append values without having to worry about hitting the size limit.

Stack memory is a special region of your computer’s memory that stores temporary variables created by each function.

The heap is a region of your computer’s memory that is not managed automatically for you, and is not as tightly managed by the CPU. It is a more free-floating region of memory (and is larger). 

**Python**
Python lists are dynamic. There is no native implementation of static lists in python. That means all lists in python can 'grow'.

## Python Lists

### Creating Lists

```python
groceries = [] # creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable "groceries"
groceries  = ['apple'] # creates a list with one item 'apple'
groceries = ['apple', 'pear', 'watermelon'] # creates a list with multiple items
groceries = [1,'apple', [], 2.3] # creates a list of an int, string, list, and double. Lists can store other lists!

a = [ "wow" ] * 5
print a  # prints ['wow', 'wow', 'wow', 'wow', 'wow']

# Using the list constructor
a = list("abcd")
print a  # prints ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

### List properties

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4]

print len(numbers) # prints 4
print max(numbers) # prints 4
print min(numbers) # prints 1

```

### Accessing Elements in a list
Say you want to access a certain item in a list. Lists are indexed by integer, starting with 0. "0-indexed".

Syntax:
listName[index]

listName is the list that you are working with.
index is the slice of the list that you want to access.


**Positive list index access**
```python
a = [12,56,29,5]
print a[0] # prints the 0th element in the list, 12
print a[2] # prints the 2nd element in the list, 29

```

**Negative list index access**
```python
a = [12,56,29,5]
print a[-1] # prints the 0th element in the list, 5
print a[-2] # prints the 2nd element in the list, 29

```

**List Slices**
You can access a subset of a list, which is called a "slice".

Syntax:
listName[x:y]

listName is the list that you are working with
x is the index that you want to start your slice
y is the index that you end your slice,up to and not including y

```python
a = [23,56,89,12,78,90]
print a[0:3] # prints a subset of list a from the 0th element up to and not including the 3rd element, [23,56,89]

# What happens when you slice out of bounds?
print a[0:100] # Doesn't throw an error, will print up to the end of the list, [23,56,89,12,78,90]

```

**Skip Slicing**

You can take slices of lists with a step. In other words, you can extract a list of every n'th element in the list.

Syntax
listName[x:y:step]
x is your staring index
y is the last index
step is how many indexes you want to skip inbetween your slices.

```python

a = [12,56,29,5,23,6,8,23]
print a[0:13:2] # prints a slice of the list from 0 to 13 (out of bounds) every other index, [12, 29, 23, 8]

```

**List Membership**
What if you want to know if an item is already in your list?
For example, imagine a grocery list
```python
groceries = ['apple', 'pear', 'grape']

```
I want to check if I added "apple" to the grocery list.

```python
print 'apple' in groceries # checks if the string apple is in groceries

```
I want to make sure I don't have  "tomato" in my grocery list.

```python
print 'tomato' not in groceries # checks if the string tomato is not in groceries, prints True
```

Count the occurances of an item in a list

```python
print groceries.count('apple') # returns 1, since there is one occurance if apple in the list groceries

numbers = [1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,6]
print numbers.count(1) # prints 3, since there are 3 occurances of 1 in the list 'numbers'

```

Find the index of the first occurance of an item

```python
numbers = [1,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,6]
numbers.index(2) # returns 3, since index 3 is the first occurance of the number 2 in list 'numbers'.

```

**Destructive vs Non-Destructive Modifications of Lists**

Destructive Modifications destroy the original list.
Non-Destructive Modifications preserve the original list.

Destructive Methods
```python
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
a.remove(6)
a.pop() # returns the last element and gets rid of it from the list
```

Destructive vs non-destructive sorting

```python

# Destructively with .sort(list)

a = [ 7, 2, 5, 3, 5, 11, 7 ]
print "At first, a =", a
a.sort()
print "After a.sort(), a =",a

# Non-Destructively with sorted(list)

a = [ 7, 2, 5, 3, 5, 11, 7 ]
print "At first"
print "   a =", a
b = sorted(a)
print "After b = sorted(a)"
print "   a =", a
print "   b =", b
```


**Swapping Indexes**

```python
# Create a list
a = [ 2, 3, 5, 7 ]
print "a =", a

# Failed swap
a[0] = a[1]
a[1] = a[0]
print "After failed swap of a[0] and a[1]"
print "   a=",a

# Reset the list
a = [ 2, 3, 5, 7 ]
print "After resetting the list"
print "   a =", a

# Swap with a temp variable
temp = a[0]
a[0] = a[1]
a[1] = temp
print "After swapping a[0] and a[1]"
print "   a =", a

# Swap with tuple assignment
a[0],a[1] = a[1],a[0]
print "After swapping a[0] and a[1] again"
print "   a =", a
```

##Looping over Lists

```python

# Create a list
a = [ 2, 3, 5, 7 ]
print "a =", a

# Looping with:  for item in list
print "Here are the items in a:"
for item in a:
    print item

# Looping with:  for index in range(len(list))
print "And here are the items with their indexes:"
for index in range(len(a)):
    print "a[", index, "] =", a[index]

# Looping backward
print "And here are the items in reverse:"
for index in range(len(a)):
    revIndex = len(a)-1-index
    print "a[", revIndex, "] =", a[revIndex]
  
```

Warning: Try not to destructively modify a list when you're iterating!
