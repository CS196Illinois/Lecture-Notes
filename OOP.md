# Object Oriented Python and Other Things

## OOP in Python

Python is an "object-supported" language, which means that it is not strictly object-oriented, but does have features that allow
programmers to use OOP if they wish.

## Syntax

Declaring a class
```python

class car:

  count = 0 # Class variable that is shared by all objects of class

  def __init__(self, brand):
    self.brand = brand # Instance variable that is unique to each object instantiation
  
  
```
