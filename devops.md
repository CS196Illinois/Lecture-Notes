Instrumentation generates autmoated alerts to all affected teams
Issue tracking tools, available to all teams in real time
end-user requests/complaints via direct contact
Service desk tools, reported separately to dev team




### How long does it to make small changes and deploy for a critical production issue?
One week? One Day?



### How are issues in production discovered?
Manual inspection by staff (ops, devs, testers)
Who does the testing?
Instrumentation, Logging
Reported by end users
Alerst are triggered when thresholds are crossed before a visible disruption in service occurs

pre-production code profiling, static code analysis , unit test, code coverage
based on bugs found
code reviews

### How od you validate user epxerience designs?
storyboard review wth product owner / internal stakeholders
written spec/doc review
storyboard review with users
A/B testing in production

### What do you do with usage data?

Usage data is inferred through feature requests and bug reports
usage data informs the next steps in the product backlog
usage data is tracked by the marketing department
usag data is combined with performance data and treated as the results o fexperiments that are run every release or AB test

### How do you manage dependencies across teams?
Maintain an artifact repository with the latest binaries and all teams pull from there
we use a work item tracking system
we keep versioned interfaces between our different services
we track them in a spreadsheet or document

## Managing Technical Debt

### How is your source code managed and versioned?
Distributed version control system
file system / shared network drives and backups
open source code sharing systems
serve-based version control system

### How do you control tech debt?
We periodically launch projects to refactor / replace / modernize major legacy systems
we avoid technical debt at all costs by rigorous tarchitecurla design and review; our existing technical deb is the result of legacy application development
and or lack of emphasis on quality in the past

we strategically incur short-term technical debt to enable experimentation and fast feedback, we track and measure this debt and pay it off promptly once the experiment is complete

we list high-value and or high-pain technical debt remediation work in our backlog

## Cloud Control

### all projects are hosted centrally in our data centers
every project or business unit can decide for themselves
all hosting needs a security review and approval for each application
we have preferred vendors and policies around the sttings for network.

## How do you provision extra infra?

order the necessary equipment themselves
provision cloud resources themselves from any supplier
use our dev test labs fro corporate approved suppliers for cloud resources
submit a request to IT

##what is your policy for using the public cloud?
teams are free to decide on their own
we dont allow use of the public cloud
its oay as long as corporate dat is not jeopardized
