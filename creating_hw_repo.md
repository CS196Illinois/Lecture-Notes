The first thing you must do with this repo is rename it to "homework-your_netID"
Go to "settings", "options", and "rename" your repository. For example, I would rename my repository to "homework-achung13".

4) Go to your newly created repo. This is where you will be submitting your homework from now on. First, clone the repo using the command

```
$ git clone <your_repo_url_here>.

```
Your repo url will be inside the file, in place of mine (its highlighted).
